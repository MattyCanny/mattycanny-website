          <p>Last month I was happy to announce that I had been playing around with an online hosted dedicated server for Son's of The Forest and was considering how it might be possible to make it available for members of my community to join in.</p>
          <p>The host that I chose was potentially quite costly if I wanted to scale the server in any way by making it available to more people.</p>
          <p>I held last month's multiplayer stream on the Sons of the Forest server and then passed the save on to a new host, and a member of my community who offered to facilitate it for me. After realising the potential, some more thought, discussion and some fluttering of my eye lashes&mdash;they then very generously agreed to make three more games available to The Mattyverse: Satisfactory, Minecraft and 7 Days to Die.</p>
          <p>It has taken a lot of planning, admin, organisation and troubleshooting, but we are now getting to the point of stability where the servers are requiring less and less maintenance and troubleshooting.</p>
          <p>The experience certainly hasn't been without its hiccoughs and memorable moments, here are some of my favourite notable stories:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tux's bugged pipe in Satisfactory, which would crash the server every time he tried to delete it. (This went on for about a week.)</li>
            <li>That time when BLAndrew575 built an amazing multistory carpark in 7 Days to Die.</li>
            <li>The mysterious Minecraft lag &amp; crashes caused by Yudie's Iron Nugget contraption.</li>
            <li>The four times I got killed in Satisfactory and went flying through the planet, which led to 2 mental breakdowns, and the creation of the arena of death. (The only place weapons are allowed to be used on other pioneers.)</li>
            <li>J1mbers recreating my pixellated face in the first seed of Minecraft before we added mods.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I have also enjoyed setting up discord bots which publish different updates about each of the game servers. One of my mods, and fellow streamer Raimen has been very helpful in giving me tutorials on navigating these, and I now consider him part of the server management team. His consultation has been fundamental.</p>
          <p>I would also like to thank J1mbers who has contributed guidance in setting up the Minecraft server, and whom I hope will continue to act as park ranger by replanting the trees and occasionally spawning thousands of fish on random players, as he has been known to do in the past.</p>
          <p>Finally, needless to say&mdash;a big thanks to Kurtis, and Hank (his bearded dragon who is really the one in charge) for their help in providing me with the facility to offer my community these amazing multiplayer experiences!</p>
